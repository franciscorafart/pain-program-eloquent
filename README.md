Simple Paint program project from Eloquent JavaScript book, chapter 19.

How it's built: 
Javascript, html. Using the canvas, select, inputs, butons and form HTML elements the program allows you to paint with different colors, brush sizes. It also allows the user to save images and load them from their computer or external URL's.

What I learnt:
With this project I learnt about encapsulating code, loading files, dataURL and the possibilities of the canvas element.
